# kali-i3-config
This is my kali i3 config and i3blocks config files based on the kali xct environment.
Note: You have to download the ShureTechMono Nerd Font from https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.2.1/ShareTechMono.zip, if you want keep the look or change, in the i3/config file, to a font you want to.
